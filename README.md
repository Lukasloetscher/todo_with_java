# todo_with_java
A website to manage my todos as well as  larp planning 


#Disclaimer: 
This is a hobby project, which i also use to learn new stuff. As such i do not always optimise for efficency, but also for fun in order to code this. (i.e. some stuff my be overengineered or simplified.)

#Plan of action:
- figure out how to connect eclipse with Github (really this can not vbe that hard...)
- set up base code for a simple version of the website (a mvp that is missing a lot of features)
- build the code as a docker file
- host teh code on the same ubuntu vm as my other page
-FOr this set up a reverse proxy (i do not want to pay for a second vm instance hence i need this reverse proxy.)
    -Either use  nginx
    -or code my own with go (/or another languag to mix it up a bit)
-Make sure everything runs again.

----------------------
After having a running site, i will start to do two things:
- add more functionality
- refactor the code to be nicer (more scaleable, easier to improve) as well as better following scleancode principles.
- ...
